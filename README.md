This table component has implemented CRUD operations on local database(a.k just a global variable),

Then enter the string in these two input boxes what you want, obviously I 
assume you will enter the right string.(i.e I don`t check what you input)

Then click the `submit` button to post your new item to local database.

and the result will be like this:

When you operate it rightly, it also will toggle a frame, and the two 
input boxes will carry with the information which you has selected.

### 4. Search operation

you can use the search input to search what you want, and no matter what 
you enter, the table will find your string in the `fruitName` and `color`
 columns, if it is, it will display like this:
